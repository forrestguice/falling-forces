package:  com.forrestguice.glstuff.gle

Files in this package are part of the Android Open Source Project. They contain
some very useful GL functionality that wasn't available in the official API (at
the time this project was created) that I've collected here. The files have been
organized into "gle" to separate them from the other "glstuff" (which is my own).
